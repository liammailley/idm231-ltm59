## Description paragraphs

### Original

Others might be tempted to call Original &quot;boring&comma;&quot; or &quot;plain&comma;&quot; or &quot;just potatoes and salt.&quot; But that&apos;s the thing- you KNOW you&apos;re just potatoes and salt. And you&apos;re proud of it. Because what you&apos;re doing with just potatoes and salt is sometimes 10x better than what those seasoning dudes are doing. You&apos;re also the only flavor my little brother will eat&comma; so&comma; uh&comma; go wild with that info I guess.

### Lightly Salted

Ok&comma; so you know what&comma; I&apos;m just gonna go with the obvious joke&colon; You know when to lay off the salt. You&apos;re not salty. Get it&quest; Because of the less salt. No gossip or pettiness for you- you&apos;re Lightly Salted Potato Chip Flavor baby&comma; and there&apos;s no telling how much blood pressure you&apos;ll lower out there.

### Salt and Vinegar

Sometimes a little sour&comma; sometimes a little salty&comma; but beloved by all. You&apos;re an international favorite who&apos;s kinda crazy and seems to show up at every party. You smell really bad on hot days though.

### BBQ

You&apos;re the dad friend. Slappin&apos; those meats down on the grill with an ice cold brew in your hand&comma; talking about 80s surfer rock or telling innaproriately timed jokes... I&apos;m playing real hard into the &apos;dad&apos; thing with this one&comma; huh&quest;

### Sour Cream and Onion

You&apos;re the best of both worlds. Would you eat sour cream by itself&quest; No. Onions by themselves&quest; I hope not. But mix them together and some strange alchemical reaction happens that makes them delicious. Uh&comma; you&apos;re like the personality version of that.

### Dill Pickle

Alright&comma; look&comma; calm down. Dill Pickle isn&apos;t THAT bad. I mean&comma; I wouldn&apos;t eat them&comma; but I know people who do&excl; And that&apos;s an honor in and of itself&comma; you know&comma; since people love to be the thing no one knows about. You&apos;re like a hipster potato&comma; which sounds like someone&apos;s Instagram username from 2010&comma; but trust me it&apos;s good. You&apos;re ahead of the curve&excl;

### Cheddar and Sour Cream

You might be a little <i>cheesy</i> sometimes&comma; but your company never gets <i>sour</i>.

And&comma; uh&comma; that&apos;s it. That&apos;s the description.

### Flamin&apos; Hot

The spicy member of any friend group; you&apos;ve got the heat&comma; you never back down from a challenge&comma; and you make my sensitive Irish stomach go into conniptions.

### Chile Limon

Sour and spicy&comma; the ultimate combo. You&apos;ve got a zing to your smile and the spice of life in your eyes. You also have 160 calories per 1 oz &lpar;28g&sol;About 15 chips&rpar;. I am on the nutrition facts page.

### Salt and Pepper

My personal favorite. You can&apos;t go wrong with a good old bag of gas station salt and pepper potato chips. Reminds me of summer days heading to the park to do God knows what on a playground for five hours. I guess I&apos;d say you&apos;re a nostalgic kind of person&comma; and no I won&apos;t expand further on that.

### Baked

The healthiest of all the flavors&comma; you&apos;re the type of person to go on a keto diet but not be obnoxious about it. To make strange dips with weird vegetables that always seem to taste good. You&apos;ve got style and taste&comma; but you could also use some salt.

### Kettle Cooked

You&apos;ve got that signature crunch to your personality. What does that mean&comma; you ask&quest; I do not know.
